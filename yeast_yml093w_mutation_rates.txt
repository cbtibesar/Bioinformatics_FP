Local Mutation rates:
A -> T / T -> A : 6.3%
C -> G / G -> C : 15.2%
C -> A / G -> T : 18.2%
A -> C / T -> G : 11.0%
A -> G / T -> C : 14.4%
C -> T / G -> A : 35.0%

"""
In order to simulate the evolutionary models within reasonable computation time, we must make some assumptions about
the number of mutations over a period of generations. For some of the genes, the mutation rate between individual
generations is too small, so we must speed up the process by adding in some determinism. To do this, we will assume
a mutation rate that is greater over a greater number of generations, so each generation in the produced list will
represent a certain number of generations that have past.
